# Portfolio

## Description

This project is my portfolio. The motivation behind this project is to show employers what I am capable of. By displaying that I can create a website from scratch, and actually make it look like a fully developed website was the challenge for me. Since this was my first official development, I understand there is room for improvement. However, as the boot camp continues and I'm able to further increase my development skills, so will the content on this website. I have further upgrades in mind already, just not the skills or knowledge for it. They will be reflected shortly. With this project I was able to go back and apply what I had learned and put it into use. Hope you like it.
